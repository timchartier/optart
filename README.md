# Polynomial mosaic 

This code creates an image mosaic using polynomials.  
Have fun and tag me on Twitter @timchartier so I can see what you make!

This page contains code to make polynomial art.

You can change any part of  the code (of course, that's the point 
of code if you are a programmer) but the most important part 
appears towards the top of the file: 

<pre>
# Input parameters 
numberOfTilesAcross = 30
numberOfPolys = 5
filename = 'monaLisa.png'
</pre>

The bigger <c>numberOfTilesAcross</c>, the more resolution you have and smaller the patch of the image that's replaced by polynomials. 

The bigger <c>numberOfPolys</c>, the more polynomials you are using in the image.  When numberOfPolys = 5, the image is using polynomials of degree 1 to 5. 

Finally, <c>filename</c> is the image you are planning to use. 

Again, have fun and tag me on Twitter @timchartier so I can see what you make!
