Polynomial mosaic 

This code creates an image mosaic using polynomials.  
Have fun and tag me on Twitter @timchartier so I can see what you make!

This page contains code to make polynomial art.  You can change any part of 
the code (of course, that's the point of code if you are a programmer) 
but the most important part is the top

<pre>
# Input parameters 
numberOfTilesAcross = 30
numberOfPolys = 5
filename = 'monaLisa.png'
</pre>

The bigger numberOfTilesAcross, the more resolution you have and smaller the patch of the image that's replaced by polynomials. 

The bigger numberOfPolys, the more polynomials you are using in the image.  When numberOfPolys = 5, the image is using polynomials of degree 1 to 5. 

Finally, filename is the image you are planning to use. 

Again, have fun and tag me on Twitter @timchartier so I can see what you make!
